  <title>Classifications</title>

<body>
  <p>The following article explains in detail how each class should be understood and used to
    define each RHH in a clear class. <strong>It is imperative each class be given correctly, as
    misclassifying something places any and all RHH 'Professionals’ in danger.</strong>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Safe</strong>: These RHH pose a limited threat, if any at all. Their only anchor to
    the rank of RHH is in its relationship with another RHH or for its reaction under critical
    conditions. Either reason should be clearly defined within said RHH’s file.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Hatery</strong>: These RHH pose a mild to severe threat. Where they fall on this scale should be very
    clearly labeled next to the ‘Hatrey’ rank with a number between 1 and 10 with 1 referring to
    mild and 10 referring to severe. An explanation for their rank placement should be clearly
    defined within said RHH’s file. It should also be made clear whether the threat is immediate
    or evoked by having either an I or an E clearly labeled next to their ‘Hatrey’ rank. This
    clarification is important, as most RHH fall under the ‘Hatrey’ class. A complete class for
    ‘Hatrey’ should appear as follows: Hatrey-6E
  </p>
  <p><strong>Quimorte</strong>: These RHH pose a severe threat at or beyond an RHH labeled ‘Hatrey-10I,’ as all
    ‘Quimorte’ classes are dangerous on contact, and should be avoided at any cost. Reasoning for
    being placed in ‘Quimorte’ may be, but is not limited to the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The alteration of time, space, or other physics. </li>
    <li>The RHH is apparently importle and/or indestructible. </li>
    <li>The RHH is a constant threat.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The reasoning for any RHH’s placement as ‘Quimorte’ should be clearly defined within said
    RHH’s file.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Blazopasno</strong>: An RHH in this category is known to hunt, assist against, or otherwise be used in
    opposition against another RHH. How it assists, and against what, should be clearly defined
    within said RHH’s file.</p>
  <p><strong>Unseen</strong>: An RHH with this rank is either only rumored to exist, or it is an RHH that has
    vanished entirely.
